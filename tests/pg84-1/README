First and third paragraphs of input are good matches for first and fifth
paragraphs in template. The second paragraph of the input is paragraphs
two and three of the template plus a significantly altered version of
paragraph four. Because of the significant differences in paragraph 4,
the combination of 2 + 3 + 4 of the template is only an 82% match for
paragraph 2 of the input.

Potentially, input paragraph 2 could be split to give good matches for
template paragraphs 2 and 3 and paragraph 4 could be retained from the
template. Currently paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 are retained because the
combination is an insufficiently good match.
