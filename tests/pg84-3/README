The short 3rd paragraph of template is split with half present at the
end of the 2nd paragraph of the input and the other at the beginning of
the 3rd paragraph. This is an unhandled case, leading to the third
paragraph of the template being retained.

The wrap generates a warning due to the additional material at the end
of 2nd paragraph. An obvious long line at the start of the 4th paragraph
is also an indicator.
